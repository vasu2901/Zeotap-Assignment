Prompt 1:
I built a Django app to connect to ClickHouse and upload CSVs. Help me implement ingestion from ClickHouse to a flat file.

Prompt 2:
I’ve written the backend functions. Just need help modifying the HTML to display tables and columns properly after connect.

Prompt 3:
Now I want it to show a message like “Your table has been downloaded to CSV” after ingestion. I’ve written the ingestion logic.

Prompt 4:
Getting this error: `InvalidChunkLength` when reading data. Any idea why this happens and how to fix it?
